My thesis project.

Requirements:

openFrameworks v0073 (or up)

ofxOsc

This project uses spatial audio to aid in orientation in 3D space.
Either use a tablet that sends UDP messages (need correct formatting, will post a guide later), or use the arrow up and command line window to add objects.
Currently there's a bug that makes the program crash when you add more items than there are sounds (two).
Use WASDQE keys to rotate around.
Use Arrow Down to reset rotation.
